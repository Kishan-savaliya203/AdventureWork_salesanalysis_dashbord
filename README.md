𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘:

➡️I had the opportunity to complete a project with Adventure Works Data set. Adventure Works is a bike manufacturer and seller and in this project I analyze their sales and returns data using Microsoft 
   Power BI Desktop.This was an end to end project beginning with importing and data cleaning and ending with the creation of visuals and optimization of those visuals.


𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒔:

➡️The raw data set given in .csv format by ADVENTUREWORKS and was imported to Power BI directly. A total of 8 files were imported, each being their own table.

➡️𝘿𝒂𝙩𝒂 𝒄𝙡𝒆𝙖𝒏𝙞𝒏𝙜: from row data I was able to get a general overview of the data set and saw that I would primarily be working with Sales and Returns data then began cleaning the data by ensuring columns 
                  were titled appropriately, they were in their correct data types, looking for missing data (which there was none) and began looking for what relationships I might be able to create 
                  between these tables.




➡️𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝒎𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈: After ensuring my data’s accuracy and consistency, began the process of creating a data model for my tables. first established my data tables which are ‘Sales Data’ and ‘Returns Data’ 
                   then set work creating relationships between tables. For this project I did not find it necessary to use any relationships other than one to many. A picture of the completed model is 
                   provided for greater understandig.

➡️𝑫𝑨𝑿 𝑭𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔:Now that I had established my table relationships, I could begin utilizing some DAX functions to analyze the data set. I started by creating basic KPI’s such as Revenue, Profit, and 
                  Total Orders which would help me to calculate more advanced metrics later on.
